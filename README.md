# BitConverter
**This repository is a fork of [this](https://github.com/sinban04/BitConverter) repository, this repository contains improvements and multi-platform support over the original library.**

This is C++ utility to handle bit and byte sequence.

It provides conversion between byte array and C++ datatypes.
In addition, It provides conversion between `std::bitset` and byte array.

The motive of this Bit Converter was the absence of bit converter in C++ like BitConverter, BitArray class in C#.
So, it refers to C# classes, and tries to make the code independent of the platform. (e.g., Endianness)

## Build

Coming soon.
